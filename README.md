Action Reaction (AR) Agency - open framework for increasing human agency


It exists to help people act together on real problems, see the consequences of their actions, learn quickly, and compound their ability to do meaningful work — without waiting for permission, funding, or authority.

This repository is the starting point.


---

## What AR Agency Is

AR Agency is not an organization that solves problems for people.

It is a structure that helps people solve problems themselves, by:

lowering the cost of taking action

making outcomes and consequences visible

supporting small groups acting locally

treating scarcity as a coordination failure, not a lack of resources


At its core, AR Agency is about agency, not efficiency, growth, or control.


---

## The Core Idea

> If people can act safely, together, and see the results of their actions,
agency grows — and scarcity dissolves as a coordination problem.



AR Agency focuses on action + reaction:

Action without reaction leads to burnout.

Reaction without action leads to cynicism.

Connecting the two builds confidence, learning, and momentum.

## Foundational Axioms

These axioms are guardrails. If the project violates them, it has failed.

**1. Agency is the primary output**
Everything exists to increase the ability of people to act meaningfully.


**2. Legibility before permission**
People should be able to see what’s possible before asking for approval.


**3. Outcome-oriented, not effort-oriented**
What changed matters more than how busy people were.


**4. Low-risk, reversible action**
Fear kills agency. Experiments must be safe to try and safe to fail.


**5. Cells over individuals**
Agency scales through small groups, not lone heroes.


**6. Spaces enable, they do not command**
Context and boundaries matter more than authority.


**7. Visibility of consequences**
Every action should leave a trace others can learn from.


**8. Exit is a success condition**
Nothing is permanent by default. Clean exits prevent capture.


**9. Anti-scarcity at all times**
Use existing capacity first. Share learning. Avoid hoarding power, knowledge, or resources.

## How AR Agency Is Structured

AR Agency has a deliberately simple structure.

**1. Individuals**

Participation is voluntary.

People only do what they feel comfortable doing.

No credentials or approval required.


**2. Action Cells (Base Layer)**

Small groups of 3–7 people

Aligned around a declared outcome

Time-bound

Shared responsibility for action and results

Cells can form, act, dissolve, or mutate freely

Action Cells are the smallest unit where agency reliably emerges.


**3. Spaces (Context Layer)**

Bounded environments that host Action Cells

Can be physical (a street, room, neighborhood)

Or virtual (a call, chat, repo, shared doc)

Spaces define:

what actions are possible

what constraints exist

what reactions will be visible

Spaces never approve actions.

They only make action legible and safe.


**4. Action / Reaction Templates (Guidance Layer)**

Lightweight guides to help cells act with confidence

Optional, not mandatory

Reduce uncertainty without introducing gatekeeping



---

## The Action Cycle Framework

The primary template used in AR Agency is the Action Cycle Framework — a practical guide for small groups to solve local problems.

The cycle:

1. Notice the issue


2. Check for support


3. Guess the cause


4. Define what “done” looks like


5. Plan the “try” (low-risk, no permission)


6. Do it and watch


7. Review the results


8. Decide next steps (share, drop, or hand off)


9. Keep it going



This cycle emphasizes:

small experiments

real-world action

honest feedback

shared learning

continuous improvement


Failure is allowed.
Opacity is not.

## What This Repository Is For

This GitHub repository is the seed location for AR Agency.

It will be used to:

define and refine the core documents

host templates and examples

capture learning from Action Cells

make the system legible and forkable


Think of this repo as:

a public notebook

a shared reference point

a place to copy from, not a place to ask permission



---

## What AR Agency Is Not

AR Agency is not:

a bureaucracy

a grant program

a social network

an activist organization

a consulting firm

a decision-making authority


It does not:

approve ideas

assign work

fund projects

enforce ideology

centralize power



---

## How to Participate (For Now)

Right now:

Read the axioms.

Use the Action Cycle Framework.

Form a small Action Cell on GitHub Discussions.

Try something real.

Write down what happened.

Share what you learned.

No signup required.

No permission needed.


---

## Status

This project is early and intentionally minimal.

Clarity comes before scale.

Practice comes before polish.

If this resonates, use it.

If it doesn’t, ignore it.


---

## License / Ethos

The intent of AR Agency is reuse, adaptation, and local ownership.

If you copy this framework and it helps people act more confidently together, it’s working.
